GCP Structure Tests
====================

The GCP Structure Tests provide a powerful framework to validate the structure 
of a container image. These tests can be used to check the output of commands 
in an image, as well as verify metadata and contents of the filesystem.

Tests can be run either through a standalone binary, or through a Docker image as part of a cloudbuild. Download the binary
[here](https://storage.googleapis.com/container-structure-test/latest/container-structure-test),
or pull the image at `gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/container-structure-test`.
**Please note that at this time the binary is only compatible with Linux.**

## Example Run
An example run of the test framework:
```shell
./structure-test -test.v -image gcr.io/google-appengine/python \
python_test_config.yaml
```
This command will run the tests on the GAE Python image, with verbose logging, 
using the python_test_config.yaml test config.

Tests within this framework are specified through a YAML or JSON config file, 
which is provided to the test driver as the last positional argument of the 
command. Multiple config files may be specified in a single test run. The 
config file will be loaded in by the test driver, which will execute the tests 
in order. Within this config file, four types of tests can be written:

- Command Tests (testing output/error of a specific command issued)
- File Existence Tests (making sure a file is, or isn't, present in the 
file system of the image)
- File Content Tests (making sure files in the file system of the image 
contain, or do not contain, specific contents)
- Metadata Test, *singular* (making sure certain container metadata is correct)

## Command Tests
Command tests ensure that certain commands run properly in the target image.
Regexes can be used to check for expected or excluded strings in both stdout 
and stderr. Additionally, any number of flags can be passed to the argument 
as normal.

#### Supported Fields:

This is the current schema version (v2.0.0).

- Name (string, **required**): The name of the test
- Setup ([][]string, *optional*): A list of commands 
(each with optional flags) to run before the actual command under test.
- Teardown ([][]string, *optional*): A list of commands 
(each with optional flags) to run after the actual command under test.
- Command (string, **required**): The command to run in the test.
- Args ([]string, *optional*): The arguments to pass to the command.
- EnvVars ([]EnvVar, *optional*): A list of environment variables to set for 
the individual test. See the **Environment Variables** section for more info.
- Expected Output ([]string, *optional*): List of regexes that should 
match the stdout from running the command.
- Excluded Output ([]string, *optional*): List of regexes that should **not** 
match the stdout from running the command.
- Expected Error ([]string, *optional*): List of regexes that should 
match the stderr from running the command.
- Excluded Error ([]string, *optional*): List of regexes that should **not** 
match the stderr from running the command.
- Exit Code (int, *optional*): Exit code that the command should exit with.

Example:
```yaml
commandTests:
  - name: "gunicorn flask"
    setup: [["virtualenv", "/env"], ["pip", "install", "gunicorn", "flask"]]
    command: "which"
    args: ["gunicorn"]
    expectedOutput: ["/env/bin/gunicorn"]
- name:  "apt-get upgrade"
  command: "apt-get"
  args: ["-qqs", "upgrade"]
  excludedOutput: [".*Inst.*Security.* | .*Security.*Inst.*"]
  excludedError: [".*Inst.*Security.* | .*Security.*Inst.*"]  
```


## File Existence Tests
File existence tests check to make sure a specific file (or directory) exist 
within the file system of the image. No contents of the files or directories 
are checked. These tests can also be used to ensure a file or directory is 
**not** present in the file system.

#### Supported Fields:

- Name (string, **required**): The name of the test
- Path (string, **required**): Path to the file or directory under test
- ShouldExist (boolean, **required**): Whether or not the specified file or 
directory should exist in the file system
- Permissions (string, *optional*): The expected Unix permission string (e.g.
  drwxrwxrwx) of the files or directory.

Example:
```yaml
fileExistenceTests:
- name: 'Root'
  path: '/'
  shouldExist: true
  permissions: '-rw-r--r--'
```

## File Content Tests
File content tests open a file on the file system and check its contents. 
These tests assume the specified file **is a file**, and that it **exists** 
(if unsure about either or these criteria, see the above 
**File Existence Tests** section). Regexes can again be used to check for 
expected or excluded content in the specified file.

#### Supported Fields:

- Name (string, **required**): The name of the test
- Path (string, **required**): Path to the file under test
- ExpectedContents (string[], *optional*): List of regexes that 
should match the contents of the file
- ExcludedContents (string[], *optional*): List of regexes that 
should **not** match the contents of the file

Example:
```yaml
fileContentTests:
- name: 'Debian Sources'
  path: '/etc/apt/sources.list'
  expectedContents: ['.*httpredir\\.debian\\.org.*']
  excludedContents: ['.*gce_debian_mirror.*']
```

## Metadata Test
The Metadata test ensures the container is configured correctly. All
of these checks are optional.

#### Supported Fields:

- Env ([]EnvVar): A list of environment variable key/value pairs that should be set
in the container.
- Entrypoint ([]string): The entrypoint of the container
- Cmd ([]string): The CMD specified in the container.
- Exposed Ports ([]string): The ports exposed in the container.
- Volumes ([]string): The volumes exposed in the container.
- Workdir (string): The default working directory of the container.

Example:
```yaml
metadataTest:
  env:
    - key: foo
      value: baz
  exposedPorts: ["8080", "2345"]
  volumes: ["/test"]
  entrypoint: []
  cmd: ["/bin/bash"]
  workdir: ["/app"]
```

## License Tests
License tests check a list of copyright files and makes sure all licenses are
allowed at Google. By default it will look at where Debian lists all copyright
files, but can also look at an arbitrary list of files.

#### Supported Fields:

- Debian (bool, **required**): If the image is based on Debian, check where
  Debian lists all licenses.
- Files (string[], *optional*): A list of other files to check.

Example:
```yaml
licenseTests:
- debian: true
  files: ["/foo/bar", "/baz/bat"]
```

### Environment Variables
A list of environment variables can optionally be specified as part of the 
test setup. They can either be set up globally (for all test runs), or 
test-local as part of individual command test runs (see the **Command Tests** 
section above). Each environment variable is specified as a key-value pair. 
Unix-style environment variable substitution is supported.

To specify, add a section like this to your config:

```yaml
globalEnvVars:
  - key: "VIRTUAL_ENV"
    value: "/env"
  - key: "PATH"
    value: "/env/bin:$PATH"
```


## Running File Tests Without Docker

Container images can be represented in multiple formats, and the Docker image 
is just one of them. At their core, images are just a series of layers, each 
of which is a tarball, and so can be interacted with without a working Docker 
daemon. While running command tests currently requires a functioning Docker 
daemon on the host machine, File Existence/Content tests do not. This can be 
particularly useful when dealing with images which have been `docker export`ed 
or saved in a different image format than the Docker format. To run tests 
without using a Docker daemon, a user can specify a different "driver" to use 
in the tests, with the `-driver` flag.

An example test run with a different driver looks like:
```shell
./structure-test -driver tar -image gcr.io/google-appengine/python \
python_test_config.yaml
```

The currently supported drivers in the framework are:
- `docker`: the default driver. 
Supports all tests, and uses the Docker daemon on the host to run them.
- `tar`: a tar driver, which converts an image to a single tarball before 
interacting with it. Does *not* support command tests.


### Running Structure Tests Through Bazel
Structure tests can also be run through bazel. 
To do so, include the rule definitions in your BUILD file:

```BUILD
load("@container-structure-test//:tests.bzl", "structure_test")
```

and create a `structure_test` rule, passing in your image and config 
file as parameters:

```BUILD
docker_build(
    name = "hello",
    base = "//java:java8",
    cmd = ["/HelloJava_deploy.jar"],
    files = [":HelloJava_deploy.jar"],
)

load("@container-structure-test//:tests.bzl", "structure_test")

structure_test(
    name = "hello_test",
    config = "testdata/hello.yaml",
    image = ":hello",
)
```
